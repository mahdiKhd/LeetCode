## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems on LeetCode, a platform for practicing algorithmic challenges. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms and data structures, and track my progress over time. The problems span a wide range of topics and difficulties.

## Languages Used

I use a variety of languages for different problems, including:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- Go
- And more...

## Solutions Structure

Each solution is placed in a folder corresponding to the problem number or the problem's topic. For example:
LeetCode |-- 1. Two Sum (Easy) | |-- two_sum.py | |-- two_sum.java | |-- 2. Add Two Numbers (Medium) | |-- add_two_numbers.py | |-- 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium) | |-- longest_substring.js

## Contributing
